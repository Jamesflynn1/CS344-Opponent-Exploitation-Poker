# CS344-Opponent-Modelling-Poker

Overleaf: https://www.overleaf.com/project/6342ef568275739c63600bb5

## Repository Structure:

Deviation_Types/
Provides an implementation of a deviation, namely the deviate and player_deviation_reach_probability functions alongside the deviation matrix.
Additionally contains generation code of 8 deviation sets.

Notebooks/
Contains all data processing and visualisation steps beyond the EV and exploitabilty calculations

Policy/
Contains a stored .csv version of the TabularPolicy object for each algorithm.

Output/
Contains per iteration information for each run and a CFR benchmark for each run. Current iteration information consists of iteration time and cumulative policy exploitability.

## How to run the EFR code:

Note: Requires a Linux environment for OpenSpiel to be installed.

1. Clone the CS344 repository locally or copy accross the following files

RunEFRExperiment.py
EFR.py
StoreTabularPolicy.py
Deviation_Types/
Deviation_Types/__init__.py
Deviation_Types/Deviation_Sets.py
Deviation_Types/Deviation.py
Deviation_Types/Swap_Transformation.py
Policy/

Optional:
RunOpponentValue.py (calculates the expected value from Policy/ files)
RunCFR.py (a wrapper to obtain the policy file for OpenSpiel CFR)
RunMCCFR.py (a wrapper to obtain the policy file for OpenSpiel ExternalSamplingMCCFR)



2. Install the Python module requirements requirements
python -m pip install -q -r requirements.txt

3. Run the 

python -Wignore RunEFRExperiment.py "bhv test2" 1000 "bhv"

Options:
Filename: the name that will be used.
Iterations: the number of update iterations that EFR will perform.
Deviation type: The type of deviation set that EFR will use
